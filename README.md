Piratemark
==========

This is a Haxe version of Iain Lobb's "Piratemark" benchmark, designed to work with either NME or Flambe.

It is designed to benchmark the use of large graphic objects with rotation, and is suitable for HTML5 performance tests.

You can build using NME like this:

    nme test html5

You can build for Flambe like this:

    nme test html5 -Duse_flambe 

The benchmark is also online, here:
